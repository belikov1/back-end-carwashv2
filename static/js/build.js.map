Глубокая полировка гарантирует удаление порядка 80% - 90% глубоких царапин, пятен\n                        кислотного дождя; 50% пятен птичьего помёта. Капли древесной смолы удалятся только те, которые\n                        проникли в ЛКП поверхностно. При такой полировке может удалиться слой лака в 10 - 20 микрон.\n                        Такую полировку не стоит делать часто.\n\n                        <br>Процесс работы – многоэтапный. Применяются грубые, одношаговые, средние пасты. Локально\n                        используется наждачная бумага 1500 -2500 для удаления капель древесной смолы и пятен птичьего\n                        помёта. Последний этап – финишная полировка.)\n                    </td>\n                    <td class=\"table-td\">7500</td>\n                    <td class=\"table-td\">9000</td>\n                    <td
